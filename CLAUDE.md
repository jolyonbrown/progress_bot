# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Building and Running
- `zig build` - Build the project (creates both executable and static library)
- `zig build run` - Build and run the bot directly
- `./run_bot.sh` - Recommended way to run the bot (handles .env file loading and displays output)
- `zig build test` - Run unit tests for both library and executable

### Development
- Test specific functionality: `zig test src/main.zig` or `zig test src/root.zig`
- Check build status: `zig build --help` shows available build steps

## Architecture

This is a Presidential Term Progress Bot that posts Bluesky updates showing the completion percentage of the current US presidential term with a visual emoji progress grid.

### Core Components

**Main Application (`src/main.zig`)**:
- Calculates presidential term progress using hardcoded start/end timestamps (Jan 20, 2025 to Jan 20, 2029)
- Generates GitHub-style progress grid using emoji squares (ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ«â¬›) representing 4 years Ã— 12 months
- Generates contextual surreal messages using Groq API based on progress and time of day
- Manages Bluesky API credentials from environment variables
- Saves progress output to `progress_update.txt`

**Build System (`build.zig`)**:
- Creates both static library and executable targets
- Links with libc for system functionality
- Supports standard Zig build options (target, optimization)

**Shell Scripts**:
- `run_bot.sh` - Main entry point that sources `.env` file and runs the bot
- `post_bluesky.sh` - AT Protocol implementation for posting to Bluesky
- `generate_surreal_message.sh` - Groq API integration for AI-generated messages
- `auto_post_bluesky.sh` & `install_cron.sh` - Automation scripts for scheduled posting

### Data Flow

1. Bot calculates time-based progress percentage
2. Generates emoji grid visualization (4Ã—12 grid representing months)
3. Calls Groq API to generate contextual surreal message (with fallback)
4. Combines data into post format and saves to `progress_update.txt`
5. If credentials available, uses shell script to post to Bluesky via AT Protocol

### Key Dependencies

- **Environment**: Requires `.env` file with Bluesky and Groq API credentials (not in git)
- **External Tools**: Uses `curl` for HTTP requests and `jq` for JSON processing
- **AI Integration**: Groq API for generating contextual surreal messages (with fallback to hashtag)

### Bluesky Integration

The bot posts twice daily (12:00 and 18:00 UTC) with AI-generated contextual messages. AT Protocol authentication is handled entirely in bash using curl and standard Unix tools rather than Zig libraries. Groq API integration provides fast, cost-effective LLM inference for dynamic message generation.

### Automation

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/post-update.yml`) runs twice daily at 12:00 and 18:00 UTC, with Ubuntu environment setup including Zig 0.11.0, dependencies, Bluesky and Groq credential handling. Posts are fully automated without user interaction using the `auto_post_bluesky.sh` script.
